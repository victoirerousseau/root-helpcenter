## Services
In general, and according to the industry standards, Akeneo will use its best efforts to take all actions and to do all things necessary, to comply with all of the terms of this Agreement. The liability of Akeneo can therefore be sought only upon demonstration of a fault exclusively attributable to Akeneo. Akeneo shall provide the Customer with the specific Akeneo Services specified on a Purchase Order. All Professional Services are only available for a maximum period of twelve (12) months starting on the Effective Date of the applicable Purchase Order. Any unused Professional Services after 12 months, will be automatically invoiced to the Customer and shall be due as per the payment terms agreed by the Parties.
## Right to use
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the limitations set forth in the Purchase Order(s), and in consideration for the payment of fees set forth on the applicable Purchase Order, Akeneo hereby grants to the Customer, solely during the applicable Subscription Term, a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable (except as set forth in [Section “Assignment”](#assignment)) right to access and use the Service solely for the Customer’s internal business purposes. This right is restricted to use by Customer and its Users and does not include the right to use the Subscription Service on behalf of any third party, unless approved in writing by Akeneo. The Customer agrees: (a) that only authorized Users are permitted to use the Service; (b) that it is responsible for Users’ actions or failures to act in connection with activities contemplated under this Agreement and (c) to otherwise take all commercially reasonable steps to protect the Service and the Documentation from unauthorized use and/or access.

The Customer acknowledges that access and use of the Subscription Service is granted to the Customer for use up to the number of Channels, Users, applicable environments, the amount of applicable storage, or other metrics purchased by the Customer and set forth and described on the applicable Purchase Order (the “Volume Limitations”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Onboarder Product will have a dedicated and specific limited number of Suppliers’ users licenses defined in an applicable Purchase Order. In the event that the Subscription Service is used in excess of the Volume Limitations then the Customer shall be obligated to promptly notify and pay Akeneo for the number of applicable Users, Channels, applicable environments, storage or other metrics used in excess of such Volume Limitations at Akeneo then current rates. The Customer may also add licenses for additional Users, Channels, production environments, storage, etc. by executing a new Purchase Order at any time.
## Future Features and Functionality
Akeneo may release Improvements and other features and functionality at its discretion. Some features and functionality may be available only with certain versions or editions of the Subscription Service, subject to additional fees, or subject to additional terms and conditions. The Customer agrees that purchases hereunder are neither contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features nor dependent on any oral or written comments made by Akeneo regarding future functionality or features.
## Third-Party Products
Customer may elect, at its discretion, to purchase Third-Party Products for use with the Subscription Service from Akeneo. Customer acknowledges that such Third-Party Products are provided by Akeneo as a “pass through” to Customer, and such Third-Party Products are covered by a warranty offered by the Third-Party software vendor, not by Akeneo. Any such Third-Party Products shall be identified as such on the Purchase Order and Customer’s use of such optional Third-Party Products will be governed by and subject to the applicable terms found at [https://marketplace.akeneo.com/terms-conditions-partners-products](https://marketplace.akeneo.com/terms-conditions-partners-products). Customer acknowledges and agrees that Akeneo makes no warranty of any kind with respect to such Third-Party Products and agrees to look solely to the applicable vendor for warranty support for such Third-Party Products. Customer also acknowledges and agrees that Akeneo’s Maintenance and Support shall not include such Third-Party Products.

# Customer responsibilities

3.1 Customer and its Users shall use the Akeneo Services reasonably in accordance with this Agreement or any Documentation, all applicable laws and in accordance with any reasonable policies established by Akeneo from time to time with respect to all of its customers generally (provided that in the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and such policies, the provisions of this Agreement shall control). If Customer or any of its Users do not comply with the terms and conditions in this Agreement or any applicable laws, Akeneo may, at its sole discretion, temporarily suspend or restrict Customer’s access to the Service without prior notice. Thereafter, Akeneo will then notify Customer according to applicable laws and regulations, and, where applicable, will work with Customer in good faith to resolve the issue.

Customer will promptly notify Akeneo of any unauthorized access to or use of its log-in credentials or account.

3.4 For the avoidance of doubt, Customer has exclusive control and responsibility for determining what Customer Data it submits to the Service and for obtaining all necessary consents and permissions for submission of Customer Data. Customer is further responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of all Customer Data, and for the acts and omissions of Authorized Users in connection with this Agreement. Customer will use reasonable measures to prevent and will promptly notify Akeneo of any known or suspected unauthorized use of Authorized User access credentials.

Each Party retains exclusive ownership of all patents, trademarks, drawings and models, software, expertise, information and all other elements belonging to it, developed or acquired prior to the entry into force of the Agreement ("Pre-existing Intellectual Property Rights"). As a consequence, no provision of the Agreement may be interpreted as explicitly or implicitly granting the transfer of ownership of any intellectual, industrial property rights or any other right whatsoever from one Party to the other without written agreement for said transfer.

Each Party shall furthermore remain the owner of all the documentation and information provided to the other Party and vice versa. Such communication of said information may under no circumstances and in no way be deemed as granting the receiving Party any usage right whatsoever or any license whatsoever over the intellectual property rights relating to the aforesaid information, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Customer shall not, as a result of any configuration or customization project, modification, alteration, enhancement or derivation, obtain any ownership to Akeneo’s technology or any intellectual property rights therein. All rights not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved by Akeneo.

Customer shall not register in Akeneo’s own name any trademarks, products, technology, designs, or patentable inventions of Akeneo. Furthermore, Customer shall not represent itself as the owner of any such mark, designs or inventions to any third-party.

Akeneo shall have the right to collect, use and distribute aggregated information, analysis, statistics, related benchmarking algorithms and other data generated by the Subscription Service (or derived from the Customer’s use of the Subscription Service) provided, however, that Akeneo shall not disclose any such data unless such data is in an aggregated anonymized form that would not permit a third party to identify the data as associated with the Customer or any of its Users. In the event Customer provides Akeneo with “Feedback” (reports about any errors, problems, or defects in, or suggestions for changes and improvement to the Subscription Service), Customer hereby grants to Akeneo an irrevocable, fully-paid up, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual and worldwide license to use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, publicly perform, and publicly display such Feedback in any medium or format, whether now known or later developed.

The parties agree that unless otherwise expressly set forth in a Purchase Order, any and all Work Product developed for the Customer in connection with any Professional Services are and shall be deemed works made for hire for the Customer under the meaning of the copyright laws of the United States and any foreign jurisdiction recognizing such right of authorship.

# Invoicing and payment

## Fees
The following terms apply to any purchase made by signing a Purchase Order. Customer will pay all fees and all incurred expenses as and when described in the applicable Purchase Order(s) (the “Fees”).

## Invoicing
Akeneo will invoice the Customer for the Fees in the currency set forth on the applicable Purchase Order. Unless otherwise set forth on the applicable Purchase Order, all undisputed invoices are payable within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Any disputed amounts will not affect payment of non-disputed amounts. Customer will make payments to the Akeneo entity and address set forth in the invoice. In addition to paying the applicable Fees, Customer shall also pay all reasonable travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Akeneo in connection with any Services rendered provided that Customer has pre-approved of such travel and expenses in writing in advance.

## Late Payment
If not subject to a good faith dispute and not paid when due, then Akeneo may at its own discretion apply a late interest rate permitted by law (which cannot be negative) added with 5% from the date such payment was due until the date paid. In addition, upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to Customer provided after the due date of any undisputed amount, Akeneo may suspend Customer’s access to the Akeneo Services if Akeneo has not received the amounts invoiced in full.

## Taxes
Fees are exclusive of taxes. Customer is responsible for the payment of all taxes, assessments, charges, fees, and levies that may be levied on or applicable to the sale or license of goods or services, as the case may be, including all sales, use, goods and services, value added, and excise taxes, customs duties, assessments, and withholding and similar taxes arising from or relating to the Akeneo Services rendered hereunder, together with any installments and any interest, fines, and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any governmental authority, including federal, state, provincial, municipal, and foreign governmental authorities (collectively “Taxes”). If Akeneo has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this Section “Taxes”, the appropriate amount will be invoiced to and paid by Customer, unless Customer provides Akeneo with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Any and all payments by or on account of the compensation payable under this Agreement will be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. If withholding taxes are imposed on any payment made by Customer to Akeneo under this Agreement, Customer shall (i) deduct such taxes from the payment made to Akeneo, (ii) timely pay the taxes to the proper taxing authority, (iii) send proof of payment to Akeneo and certify receipt of such payment by the taxing authority within thirty (30) days following receipt of such certification from the taxing authority and (iv) increase the amount payable to Akeneo so that Akeneo receives the full amount it would have received had no such taxes been withheld (including additional amounts withheld on amounts payable pursuant to this Section “Taxes”). Customer (and/or its successors, assigns or affiliates) shall be responsible for all additions to tax, interest and penalty charges imposed with respect to any failure to timely withhold and/or remit any required withholding tax. 

# Term; Termination

## Term
Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Purchase Order, such Purchase Order will have an Initial Term of three (3) years starting on the first day of the Initial Term set forth in the applicable Purchase Order (“Effective Date” or “Start Date”). Prior to the end of the Initial Term, Parties agree to enter into renewal negotiations one hundred and twenty (120) days from the anniversary date. If the Parties fail to enter into a renewal agreement, the Agreement will automatically expire unless explicitly extended by an instrument in writing signed by both Parties.

## Termination
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may terminate this Agreement or any Purchase Order (i) immediately in the event of a material breach of this Agreement or any such Purchase Order by the other Party that is not cured within thirty (30) days of written notice from the other Party, or (ii) immediately if the other Party ceases doing business or is the subject of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding, that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days of filing. Termination of a Purchase Order shall not be deemed a termination of this Agreement. Termination of this Agreement shall, however, terminate all outstanding Purchase Orders. 

## Effect of Termination
Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement or any applicable Purchase Order, Akeneo shall no longer provide the applicable Akeneo Services to the Customer and the Customer shall promptly cease and cause its Users to promptly cease using the Akeneo Services. Customer shall pay Akeneo for all Fees that had accrued prior to the termination date. Except as expressly provided herein, termination of this Agreement by either party will be a nonexclusive remedy for breach and will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of such party. If the Purchase Order is terminated for any reason other than a termination as a result of Akeneo’s material breach, then Akeneo shall be entitled to all of the Fees due under the applicable Purchase Order for the entire unexpired terminated portion of the term of such Purchase Order. If the Purchase Order is terminated as a result of Akeneo’s material breach, then Customer shall be entitled to a refund of the pro rata portion of any prepaid Fees paid by Customer to Akeneo under the Purchase Order for the remaining unexpired terminated portion of the Term. Upon termination of this Agreement, each party shall promptly destroy all Confidential Information of the other party in its possession.

## Survival
Any provision of this Agreement that, either by its terms or to give effect to its meaning, shall survive and such other provisions that expressly or by their nature are intended to survive termination, will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

# Indemnification

## Akeneo Indemnification
Subject to [Section “Indemnification Procedure”](#indemnification-procedure) below, Akeneo will defend Customer, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the "Customer Indemnitees"), against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against any of the Customer Indemnitees by a third party alleging that the Akeneo Services infringe or misappropriate such third-party's intellectual property rights (a "Claim Against Customer"), and will indemnify the Customer Indemnitees for any damages (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) finally awarded against any of the Customer Indemnitees as a result of, or for amounts paid by under a court-approved settlement of, a Claim Against Customer. If a Claim against Customer is brought or is likely, in Akeneo's sole opinion, to be brought, Akeneo will, at its option and expense (A) obtain the right for Customer to continue using the Akeneo Services; (B) replace or modify the affected Akeneo Services so that they become non-infringing; or (C) upon notice to Customer, terminate this Agreement or Customer's use of the affected Akeneo Services, provided that in the case of (C) Akeneo promptly refunds to Customer the prorated portion of any unearned pre-paid fees paid hereunder for the affected Akeneo Services. Akeneo's obligations in this Section “Akeneo Indemnification” do not cover third party claims to the extent such claims arise from: (i) any products, services, technology, materials or data not created or provided by Akeneo (including without limitation any Customer Content or Third Party Products), (ii) any part of the Akeneo Services made in whole or in part in accordance to Customer specifications, (iii) any modifications made after delivery by Akeneo, (iv) any combination with other products, processes or materials not provided by Akeneo (where the alleged damages, costs or expenses arise from or relate to such combination), (v) where Customer continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (vi) Customer’s use of the Akeneo Services is not strictly in accordance with this Agreement or any Documentation.

## Customer Indemnification
Subject to [Section “Indemnification Procedure”](#indemnification-procedure) below, Customer will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Akeneo, its Affiliates and its respective officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the "Akeneo Indemnitees") from and against any and all claim, loss, damage, demand, penalties, indemnities, suit or proceeding, including reasonable legal fees) made or brought against any or all of the Akeneo Indemnitees by a third-party (i) alleging that the Customer Content, or any use thereof, infringes the intellectual property rights or proprietary rights of others, or has caused harm to a third party, (ii) arising out of or attributable to Customer’s breach of this Agreement, or (iii) arising out of or attributable to Customer’s misuse of the Subscription Services (each, a "Claim Against Akeneo"), and will indemnify the Akeneo Indemnitees from any damages, reasonable attorney fees and costs finally awarded against the Akeneo Indemnitees as a result of, or for any amounts paid under a court-approved settlement of a Claim Against Akeneo.

## Indemnification Procedure
Each Party’s obligation to indemnify the other party is conditioned on the Party seeking indemnification: (i) promptly notifying the indemnifying Party in writing of any claim, suit or proceeding for which indemnity is claimed, provided that failure to so notify will not remove the indemnifying Party’s obligation except to the extent it is prejudiced thereby, (ii) allowing the indemnifying Party to solely control the defense of any claim, suit or proceeding and all negotiations for settlement; provided that the indemnifying Party may not settle any claim that requires the indemnified Party to admit fault without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and (iii) providing the indemnifying Party with reasonable assistance in the defense and settlement of any claim, suit or proceeding for which indemnity is claimed.

This exclusion will apply regardless of the legal theory upon which any claim for such damages is based, whether the parties had been advised of the possibility of such damages, whether such damages were reasonably foreseeable, or whether application of the exclusion causes any remedy to fail of its essential purpose.

## Limitation of liability
Except as set forth in [Section “Exceptions”](#exceptions) below, the maximum liability of each party in connection with this Agreement shall be limited to and not exceed the fees paid or payable by Customer for the Subscription Service subject to the claim during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date on which the cause of action arose.

## Exceptions

## Injunctive Relief
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, both Parties acknowledge that any use of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement may cause the disclosing Party irreparable and immediate damage for which remedies other than injunctive relief may be inadequate.

# Exhibit A - Service Level Agreement and Maintenance and Support

## Service Level Agreement
### Definitions

**Percentage Uptime**  
means the availability of the Akeneo Subscription Service expressed as a percentage and calculated by multiplying 100 times the quotient of (i) total number of minutes the Akeneo Subscription Service is available (other than unavailability due to Permitted Downtime as defined below) in the applicable calendar month divided by (ii) the total number of minutes in the month less Permitted Downtime.

**Permitted Downtime**  
means the following:  
a)  Inoperability due to any scheduled Maintenance and Support Services (occurring during a Scheduled Maintenance Period);  
b)  Problems caused by Customer’s or its Users’ telecommunications or Internet services;  
c)  Problems due to a Force Majeure Events;   
d)  Problems caused by Customer Content or Third Party Products;  
e)  Problems due to acts or omissions of Customer, its agents, employees or contractors; or  
f)  Any interruption of one (1) minute or less in the availability of the Akeneo Subscription Service;

**Scheduled Maintenance Period**  
means the period of time elapsed during any scheduled Maintenance and Support Services performed by Akeneo on the Subscription Service. Akeneo will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule Maintenance and Support Services during hours of Friday at 11:00 pm EST and Saturday 10 am EST. Scheduled Maintenance and Support Services notifications will be sent to a single Customer email address. It is Customer’s sole responsibility to ensure the provided email address is current and fully functional. Any change to Customer’s email address for notification purposes must be communicated to Akeneo in writing.

### Uptime
Akeneo will use best efforts to ensure that the Percentage Uptime in any calendar month is at least 99.5%.  In the event Akeneo fails to achieve Percentage Uptime of at least 99.5% two (2) calendar months in a row then Customer shall have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy for any such failure, to terminate the Agreement.

## Backup and Security
Akeneo will perform periodically backups of Customer Content from Customer's production environment pursuant to the below frequency:  
- 1 time per day for the last thirty (30) days.

Security measures implemented by Akeneo’s hosting provider are described at the following address: [https://cloud.google.com/security/](https://cloud.google.com/security/).

Akeneo undertakes to inform and to alert the Customer, by any means, as soon as the storage capacity of the Platform reaches 70%. At the same time of this alert, Akeneo will send a quote to the Customer in order to increase its storage capacity.

Within the next 48 hours upon receiving the alert and the quote, the Customer must then inform Akeneo of its choice to increase the storage capacity and thus return the quote accepted and signed for Purchase of additional storage whose financial conditions will be defined in the quote communicated by Akeneo to the Customer, so that the Platform can continue to operate normally.

Failing to reply, the Customer is fully aware that overloading (the saturation of) its storage capacity may cause, at any time, one or more malfunction(s) up to  a complete shutdown of its instance (PIM) without Akeneo being held liable for such unavailability or disturbance.

Therefore, the Customer:
- Will be held responsible for any failure of the Platform and cannot transfer such responsibility to Akeneo; and
- Will have to pay a flat-rate compensation fee in the amount of 2,000 € excl. Tax (two thousand euros excluding taxes), on top of the additional storage charge required, for each intervention by Akeneo team in order to restart the Platform.
