The liability of Akeneo can therefore be seek only upon demonstration of a fault exclusively attributable to Akeneo. Akeneo shall provide the Customer with the specific Akeneo Services specified on a Purchase Order. All Professional Services are only available for a maximum period of twelve (12) months starting on the Effective Date of the applicable Purchase Order. Any unused Professional Services after 12 months, will be automatically invoiced to the Customer and shall be due as per the payment terms agreed by the Parties.

This right is restricted to use by Customer and its Users and does not include the right to use the Subscription Service on behalf of any third party, unless approved in writing by Akeneo. The Customer agrees: (a) that only authorized Users are permitted to use the Service; (b) that it is responsible for Users’ actions or failures to act in connection with activities contemplated under this Agreement and (c) to otherwise take all commercially reasonable steps to protect the Service and the Documentation from unauthorized use and/or access.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Onboarder Product will have a dedicated and specific limited number of Suppliers’ users licenses defined in an applicable Purchase Order. In the event that the Subscription Service is used in excess of the Volume Limitations then the Customer shall be obligated to promptly notify and pay Akeneo for the number of applicable Users, Channels, applicable environments, storage or other metrics used in excess of such Volume Limitations at Akeneo then current rates. The Customer may also add licenses for additional Users, Channels, production environments, storage, etc. by executing a new Purchase Order at any time.

Customer acknowledges that such Third-Party Products are provided by Akeneo as a “pass through” to Customer, and such Third-Party Products are covered by a warranty offered by the Third-Party software vendor, not by Akeneo.

Each Party shall furthermore remain the owner of all the documentation and information provided to the other Party and vice versa. Such communication of said information may under no circumstances and in no way be deemed as granting the receiving Party any usage right whatsoever or any license whatsoever over the intellectual property rights relating to the aforesaid information, except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement.
Customer shall not, as a result of any configuration or customization project, modification, alteration, enhancement or derivation, obtain any ownership to Akeneo’s technology or any intellectual property rights therein. All rights not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved by Akeneo.

# Invoicing and payment

## Fees
The following terms apply to any purchase made by signing a Purchase Order. Customer will pay all fees and all incurred expenses as and when described in the applicable Purchase Order(s) (the “Fees”).

## Invoicing
Akeneo will invoice the Customer for the Fees in the currency set forth on the applicable Purchase Order. Unless otherwise set forth on the applicable Purchase Order, all undisputed invoices are payable within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Any disputed amounts will not affect payment of non-disputed amounts. Customer will make payments to the Akeneo entity and address set forth in the invoice. In addition to paying the applicable Fees, Customer shall also pay all reasonable travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Akeneo in connection with any Services rendered provided that Customer has pre-approved of such travel and expenses in writing in advance.

## Late Payment
If not subject to a good faith dispute and not paid when due, then Akeneo may at its own discretion apply a late interest rate permitted by law (which cannot be negative) added with 5% from the date such payment was due until the date paid. In addition, upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to Customer provided after the due date of any undisputed amount, Akeneo may suspend Customer’s access to the Akeneo Services if Akeneo has not received the amounts invoiced in full.

## Taxes
Fees are exclusive of taxes. Customer is responsible for the payment of all taxes, assessments, charges, fees, and levies that may be levied on or applicable to the sale or license of goods or services, as the case may be, including all sales, use, goods and services, value added, and excise taxes, customs duties, assessments, and withholding and similar taxes arising from or relating to the Akeneo Services rendered hereunder, together with any installments and any interest, fines, and penalties with respect thereto, imposed by any governmental authority, including federal, state, provincial, municipal, and foreign governmental authorities (collectively “Taxes”). If Akeneo has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this Section “Taxes”, the appropriate amount will be invoiced to and paid by Customer, unless Customer provides Akeneo with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Any and all payments by or on account of the compensation payable under this Agreement will be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. If withholding taxes are imposed on any payment made by Customer to Akeneo under this Agreement, Customer shall (i) deduct such taxes from the payment made to Akeneo, (ii) timely pay the taxes to the proper taxing authority, (iii) send proof of payment to Akeneo and certify receipt of such payment by the taxing authority within thirty (30) days following receipt of such certification from the taxing authority and (iv) increase the amount payable to Akeneo so that Akeneo receives the full amount it would have received had no such taxes been withheld (including additional amounts withheld on amounts payable pursuant to this Section “Taxes”). Customer (and/or its successors, assigns or affiliates) shall be responsible for all additions to tax, interest and penalty charges imposed with respect to any failure to timely withhold and/or remit any required withholding tax. 

# Term; Termination

## Term
Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Purchase Order, such Purchase Order will have an Initial Term of three (3) years starting on the first day of the Initial Term set forth in the applicable Purchase Order (“Effective Date” or “Start Date”). Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Purchase Order, all Purchase Orders for the Subscription Service will thereafter automatically renew for the same period of time as the initial Subscription Term (each a “Renewal Term”) unless either party notifies the other party at least ninety (90) days prior to the then current expiration date of the Initial Term or the Renewal Term, as the case may be, that it has elected not to renew the Purchase Order. Akeneo reserves the right to change the rates, applicable charges and usage policies and to introduce new charges, for such Purchase Order upon providing Customer with written notice thereof (which notice may be provided by e-mail) at least 60 days prior to the then current renewal date of the Purchase Order.

## Termination
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may terminate this Agreement or any Purchase Order (i) immediately in the event of a material breach of this Agreement or any such Purchase Order by the other Party that is not cured within thirty (30) days of written notice from the other Party, or (ii) immediately if the other Party ceases doing business or is the subject of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding, that is not dismissed within sixty (60) days of filing. Termination of a Purchase Order shall not be deemed a termination of this Agreement. Termination of this Agreement shall, however, terminate all outstanding Purchase Orders. Either Party may also terminate this Agreement upon no less than thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party for any reason, if at such time there are no outstanding Purchase Orders then currently in effect. 

## Effect of Termination
Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement or any applicable Purchase Order, Akeneo shall no longer provide the applicable Akeneo Services to the Customer and the Customer shall promptly cease and cause its Users to promptly cease using the Akeneo Services. Customer shall pay Akeneo for all Fees that had accrued prior to the termination date. Except as expressly provided herein, termination of this Agreement by either party will be a nonexclusive remedy for breach and will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of such party. If the Purchase Order is terminated for any reason other than a termination as a result of Akeneo’s material breach, then Akeneo shall be entitled to all of the Fees due under the applicable Purchase Order for the entire unexpired terminated portion of the term of such Purchase Order. If the Purchase Order is terminated as a result of Akeneo’s material breach, then Customer shall be entitled to a refund of the pro rata portion of any prepaid Fees paid by Customer to Akeneo under the Purchase Order for the remaining unexpired terminated portion of the Term. Upon termination of this Agreement, each party shall promptly destroy all Confidential Information of the other party in its possession. 
6.4 Survival. Any provision of this Agreement that, either by its terms or to give effect to its meaning, shall survive and such other provisions that expressly or by their nature are intended to survive termination, will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Sections IPR, Confidentiality, Indemnification, Limitation of Liability and General shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

# Indemnification

## Akeneo Indemnification
Subject to [Section “Indemnification Procedure”](#indemnification-procedure) below, Akeneo will defend Customer, its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the "Customer Indemnitees"), against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against any of the Customer Indemnitees by a third party alleging that the Akeneo Services infringe or misappropriate such third-party's intellectual property rights (a "Claim Against Customer"), and will indemnify the Customer Indemnitees for any damages (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) finally awarded against any of the Customer Indemnitees as a result of, or for amounts paid by under a court-approved settlement of, a Claim Against Customer. If a Claim against Customer is brought or is likely, in Akeneo's sole opinion, to be brought, Akeneo will, at its option and expense (A) obtain the right for Customer to continue using the Akeneo Services; (B) replace or modify the affected Akeneo Services so that they become non-infringing; or (C) upon notice to Customer, terminate this Agreement or Customer's use of the affected Akeneo Services, provided that in the case of (C) Akeneo promptly refunds to Customer the prorated portion of any unearned pre-paid fees paid hereunder for the affected Akeneo Services. Akeneo's obligations in this Section “Akeneo Indemnification” do not cover third party claims to the extent such claims arise from: (i) any products, services, technology, materials or data not created or provided by Akeneo (including without limitation any Customer Content or Third Party Products), (ii) any part of the Akeneo Services made in whole or in part in accordance to Customer specifications, (iii) any modifications made after delivery by Akeneo, (iv) any combination with other products, processes or materials not provided by Akeneo (where the alleged damages, costs or expenses arise from or relate to such combination), (v) where Customer continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (vi) Customer’s use of the Akeneo Services is not strictly in accordance with this Agreement or any Documentation.

## Customer Indemnification
Subject to [Section “Indemnification Procedure”](#indemnification-procedure) below, Customer will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Akeneo, its Affiliates and its respective officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the "Akeneo Indemnitees") from and against any and all claim, loss, damage, demand, penalties, indemnities, suit or proceeding, including reasonable legal fees) made or brought against any or all of the Akeneo Indemnitees by a third-party (i) alleging that the Customer Content, or any use thereof, infringes the intellectual property rights or proprietary rights of others, or has caused harm to a third party, (ii) arising out of or attributable to Customer’s breach of this Agreement, or (iii) arising out of or attributable to Customer’s misuse of the Subscription Services (each, a "Claim Against Akeneo"), and will indemnify the Akeneo Indemnitees from any damages, reasonable attorney fees and costs finally awarded against the Akeneo Indemnitees as a result of, or for any amounts paid under a court-approved settlement of a Claim Against Akeneo.

## Indemnification Procedure
Each Party’s obligation to indemnify the other party is conditioned on the Party seeking indemnification: (i) promptly notifying the indemnifying Party in writing of any claim, suit or proceeding for which indemnity is claimed, provided that failure to so notify will not remove the indemnifying Party’s obligation except to the extent it is prejudiced thereby, (ii) allowing the indemnifying Party to solely control the defense of any claim, suit or proceeding and all negotiations for settlement; provided that the indemnifying Party may not settle any claim that requires the indemnified Party to admit fault without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and (iii) providing the indemnifying Party with reasonable assistance in the defense and settlement of any claim, suit or proceeding for which indemnity is claimed.

## Sole Remedy

# Limitation of liability

## Exclusion of liability
Except as set forth in [Section “Exceptions”](#exceptions) below, to the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will either Party, its directors, employees, agents, or licensors be liable for any loss of actual or anticipated income, loss of actual or anticipated profits, loss of goodwill or data, loss of contract, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, special, or exemplary damages arising out of or that relate in any way to this Agreement or its performance that result from the use of, or inability to use, the Akeneo Services or any other aspect of this Agreement. This exclusion will apply regardless of the legal theory upon which any claim for such damages is based, whether the parties had been advised of the possibility of such damages, whether such damages were reasonably foreseeable, or whether application of the exclusion causes any remedy to fail of its essential purpose.

## Limitation of liability
Except as set forth in [Section “Exceptions”](#exceptions) below, the maximum liability of each party in connection with this Agreement shall be limited to and not exceed the fees paid or payable by Customer for the Subscription Service subject to the claim during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date on which the cause of action arose.

## Exceptions
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to exclude or restrict or will be construed as excluding or restricting the liability of either party for (a) indemnification obligations under this Agreement; (b) any violation by the customer of Akeneo’s intellectual property rights in and to the Subscription Service; or (c) any liability that cannot be limited or excluded by applicable law.

Each party acknowledges that the limitations of liability set forth in this section reflect the allocation of risk between the parties under this agreement, and that in the absence of such limitations of liability, the economic terms of this agreement would be significantly different.

Customer’s exclusive remedies for any interruption or cessation of access or transmission to or from the Subscription Service are set forth in Akeneo’s service level agreement.

# Confidentiality

## Confidential Information
As used in this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means all information of either party that is not generally known to the public, whether of a technical, business or other nature, that is disclosed by one party to the other party or that is otherwise learned by the receiving Party in the course of its activities with the disclosing Party, and that has been identified as being proprietary and/or confidential or that the receiving Party reasonably ought to know, should be treated as proprietary and/or confidential. The terms and pricing on each Purchase Order shall be deemed Confidential Information. Each party shall use reasonable care to hold the other party’s Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose such Confidential Information to anyone other than to its employees, contractors, attorneys, and accountants with a need to know. A receiving Party shall not reproduce or use such Confidential Information for any purpose other than as reasonably required to perform pursuant to this Agreement or as reasonably necessary for use of the Subscription Service as contemplated by this Agreement.

## Exclusions
Information will not be deemed Confidential Information hereunder if such information: (i) is known by the receiving Party prior to receipt from the disclosing Party, without any obligation of confidentiality; (ii) becomes known to the receiving Party directly or indirectly from a source other than one having an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing Party; (iii) becomes publicly known or otherwise publicly available, except through a breach of this Agreement; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving Party without use of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.  The receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to the requirements of applicable law, legal process or government regulation, provided that it gives the disclosing Party reasonable prior written notice to permit the disclosing Party to contest such disclosure, and such disclosure is otherwise limited to the required disclosure.

## Injunctive Relief
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, both Parties acknowledge that any use of the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement may cause the disclosing Party irreparable and immediate damage for which remedies other than injunctive relief may be inadequate.  Therefore, both Parties agree that, in addition to any other remedy to which the disclosing Party may be entitled hereunder, at law or equity, the disclosing Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions (without the posting of any bond and without proof of actual damages) to restrain such use in addition to other appropriate remedies available under applicable law.

# Exhibit A - Service Level Agreement and Maintenance and Support

## Service Level Agreement
### Definitions

**Percentage Uptime**  
means the availability of the Akeneo Subscription Service expressed as a percentage and calculated by multiplying 100 times the quotient of (i) total number of minutes the Akeneo Subscription Service is available (other than unavailability due to Permitted Downtime as defined below) in the applicable calendar month divided by (ii) the total number of minutes in the month less Permitted Downtime.

**Permitted Downtime**  
means the following:  
a)  Inoperability due to any scheduled Maintenance and Support Services (occurring during a Scheduled Maintenance Period);  
b)  Problems caused by Customer’s or its Users’ telecommunications or Internet services;  
c)  Problems due to a Force Majeure Events;   
d)  Problems caused by Customer Content or Third Party Products;  
e)  Problems due to acts or omissions of Customer, its agents, employees or contractors; or  
f)  Any interruption of one (1) minute or less in the availability of the Akeneo Subscription Service;

**Scheduled Maintenance Period**  
means the period of time elapsed during any scheduled Maintenance and Support Services performed by Akeneo on the Subscription Service. Akeneo will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule Maintenance and Support Services during hours of Friday at 11:00 pm EST and Saturday 10 am EST. Scheduled Maintenance and Support Services notifications will be sent to a single Customer email address. It is Customer’s sole responsibility to ensure the provided email address is current and fully functional. Any change to Customer’s email address for notification purposes must be communicated to Akeneo in writing.

### Uptime
Akeneo will use best efforts to ensure that the Percentage Uptime in any calendar month is at least 99.5%.  In the event Akeneo fails to achieve Percentage Uptime of at least 99.5% two (2) calendar months in a row then Customer shall have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy for any such failure, to terminate the Agreement.

## Backup and Security
Akeneo will perform periodically backups of Customer Content pursuant to the below frequency:  
- On the Subscription Service:
    - Daily for the last 10 days
    - Once per week for the last 5 weeks
- On External backup system:
    - Once per month for the last 12 months
    - Once per year for the last 10 years

Security measures implemented by Akeneo’s hosting provider are described at the following address: [https://cloud.google.com/security/](https://cloud.google.com/security/).

Akeneo undertakes to inform and to alert the Customer, by any means, as soon as the storage capacity of the Platform reaches 70%. At the same time of this alert, Akeneo will send a quote to the Customer in order to increase its storage capacity.

Within the next 48 hours upon receiving the alert and the quote, the Customer must then inform Akeneo of its choice to increase the storage capacity and thus return the quote accepted and signed for Purchase of additional storage whose financial conditions will be defined in the quote communicated by Akeneo to the Customer, so that the Platform can continue to operate normally.

Failing to reply, the Customer is fully aware that overloading (the saturation of) its storage capacity may cause, at any time, one or more malfunction(s) up to  a complete shutdown of its instance (PIM) without Akeneo being held liable for such unavailability or disturbance.

Therefore, the Customer:
- Will be held responsible for any failure of the Platform and cannot transfer such responsibility to Akeneo; and
- Will have to pay a flat-rate compensation fee in the amount of 2,000 € excl. Tax (two thousand euros excluding taxes), on top of the additional storage charge required, for each intervention by Akeneo team in order to restart the Platform.
